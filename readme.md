# Mini Shopify

## Description

This project aims to create a similar to Shopify where merchants create a shop by filling in a form that has the name of the shop, the categories related to the shop and some other fields. The merchant can upload the images of the products with their price and a brief description. Consumers can find the products just by searching the name of the product or by searching the categories. Buyers can one or multiple products at one time. The purchase of the product process is that the customers select the product/s and add to shopping cart and at the last step proceeds with their card information to make the purchase.
